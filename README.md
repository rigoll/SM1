A Cigarette pez Machine. This is a voice activated machine that ejects cigarettes.

### Project Status
I started building this because a wanted to work a little bit with servermotors, and also explore more of what C++ can be used for. It has a few mechanisms that proved to be hard to build out of foam plastic (wich I use to build prototypes) and for that reason I decided to buy a 3d printer. Most of the part is already printed. But as some parts are small so is my knowledge in CAD. As soon as a learn enough CAD i will print the final parts.

### Reflection
Reflections so far is that 3d printing is the future.
